# WHAT'S THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS REPOSITORYðŸ¤” 
In this repository we're going to demonstrate implementations of CNN's(convolutional neural networks) in addiction with algorithms for classification or regretion.
## These were the CNN's + algorithm that we used
- VGG16 + RF/ SVM
- VGG19 + RF/ SVM
- RESNET + RF/ SVM
- ALEXNET + RF/ SVM
- INCEPTION + RF/ SVM
## DATASET
In this project we use the CRIC(Center for Recognition and Inspection of Cells) dataset. This dataset has an amount of digital images of cervical cells from pap smears
